### Tema 1 - Now You See Me
--------------------------
--------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Description:

* This project is basically a library for deck of cards. It allows storage
of sequences of cards using double linked lists. 
* It works by creating a list with decks using generic structures that 
hold pointers to each deck of cards which is itself a double linked list.
* This piece of software supports commands such as:

* ADD_DECK <number_of_cards>
* DEL_DECK <deck_index>
* DEL_CARD <deck_index> <card_index>
* ADD_CARDS <deck_index> <number_of_cards>
* DECK_NUMBER
* DECK_LEN <deck_index>
* SHUFFLE_DECK <deck_index>
* MERGE_DECKS <deck_index>_1 <deck_index_2>
* SPLIT_DECK <deck_index> <index_split>
* REVERSE_DECK <deck_index>
* SHOW_DECK <deck_index>
* SHOW_ALL
* SORT_DECK <deck_index>
* EXIT

### Comments on this project:


**  What could have gone better?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* I really think I could do a more compact and a little better organised
implementation. However, I do think I did a pretty good job on handling
data structures and thinking this whole project.
* It took much more time than I expected especially because I had to remake
it almost whole after not using generic structures the first time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


** What did you learn while working on this project?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* I learned how to better handle simple data structures: lists of all sorts.
* I also learned how to handle memory leakes problems when using very
abstract memory allocation for lists in lists.

** How to run it:
make && ./tema1
